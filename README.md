# Unsupervised-Learning
 Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.Some of the unsupervised learning tasks are clusteing,anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction.
    
 In this project, we are going to look at 
*   PCA
*   Kernel PCA
*   K-meanS clustering
*   DBSCAN clustering
*   Agglomerative Clustering
*   GMM clustering
*   Anomaly detection using GMM 
*   Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest

We are going to work on diabetes dataset.The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.If outcome is 1,the person is having diabetes and if it zero,no diabetes.
